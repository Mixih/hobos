# YAEOS

Yet Another Experimental OS

## Overview

YAEOS is completely experimental and meant to be more of an educational
experience than anything else. Preliminary architecture is expected to be a
monokernel, with all drivers initially in the OS image. The initial target will
be a BIOS-based boot system, with single socket SMP supported from the
beginning.
